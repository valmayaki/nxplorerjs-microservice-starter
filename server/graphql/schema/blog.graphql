# The concepts have been picked up from https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tutorial
# and modified to change the implementation logic and schema
# The model - Blogs have comments which can be paginated via a cursor
#
type Blog {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  comments: [Comment]
  # comments will be returned in a CommentFeed object wrapper
  commentFeed(cursor: String, limit: Int): CommentFeed
}

input CommentInput {
  blogId: ID!
  text: String
}

type Comment {
  id: ID!
  text: String
  createdAt: Date
}

type CommentFeed {
  # cursor specifies the place in the list where we left off
  cursor: String!
  hasNextPage: Boolean!
  # this is a chunk of comments to be returned
  comments: [Comment]!
}
